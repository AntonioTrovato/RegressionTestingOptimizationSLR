abstract = {Regression testing is an important but extremely costly and time-consuming process. Because of limited resources in practice, test case prioritization focuses on the improvement of testing efficiency. However, traditional test case prioritization techniques emphasize only one-time testing without considering huge historical data generated in regression testing. This paper proposes an approach to prioritizing test cases based on historical data. Requirements are a significant factor in the testing process, the priorities of test cases are initialized based on requirement priorities in our history-based approach, and then are calculated dynamically according to historical data in regression testing. To evaluate our approach, an empirical study on an industrial system is conducted. Experimental results show an improved performance for our proposed method using measurements of Average Percentage of Faults Detected and Fault Detection Rate.},

abstract = {For regression testing in the continuous integration environments, the time and cost should be considered; to satisfy these constraints, it is necessary to improve the test efficiency regarding the achievement of the test goal. It is especially important to identify the problem quickly by first executing a test case with a high probability of failure. This paper therefore proposes the FHD (&lt;u&gt;F&lt;/u&gt;ailure &lt;u&gt;H&lt;/u&gt;istory &lt;u&gt;D&lt;/u&gt;ata)-Prioritization technique for the purpose of effective regression testing. This technique uses the failed test case history, the flipped result of method test case and the correlation data as the prioritization criteria, and the algorithm is designed to calculate the weight through the following two-step classification: 1) The FHD-Prioritization analyzes the failure history data statistically and sequentially arranges the test cases from the highest failure occurrence probability in the current session. 2) If a failure occurs during the test, the FHD-Prioritization reprioritizes in real time based on the correlation data. The performance of the FHD-Prioritization technique is evaluated with Tomcat and Camel, Apache open source software projects that were developed in the continuous integration environment. Because all of these projects are composed of the real faults of real-world projects, it is possible to practically evaluate the efficiency of the proposed approach. The FHD-Prioritization improved the efficiency of test case prioritization by about 5.62+ and 2.17+, respectively, compared to ROCKET and AFSAC.},

abstract = {Regression testing is a way of catching bugs in new builds and releases to avoid the product risks. Corrective, progressive, retest all and selective regression testing are strategies to perform regression testing. Retesting all existing test cases is one of the most reliable approaches but it is costly in terms of time and effort. This limitation opened a scope to optimize regression testing cost by selecting only a subset of test cases that can detect faults in optimal time and effort. This paper proposes Pareto based Multi-Objective Harmony Search approach for regression test case selection from an existing test suite to achieve some test adequacy criteria. Fault coverage, unique faults covered and algorithm execution time are utilised as performance measures to achieve optimization criteria. The performance evaluation of proposed approach is performed against Bat Search and Cuckoo Search optimization. The results of statistical tests indicate significant improvement over existing approaches.},

abstract = {Regression testing is a safety measure to attest that changes made on a system preserve prior accepted behavior. Identifying which test cases must compose a regression test suite in a certain development stage is tricky, particularly when one only has test cases and change requests described in natural language, and the execution of the test suite will be performed manually. That is the case of our industrial partner. We propose a selection of regression test cases based on information retrieval and implement as a web-service. In performed experiments, we show that we can improve the creation of regression test suites of our industrial partner by providing more effective test cases based on keywords analysis in an automatic way.},

abstract = {We present a new approach for automatically prioritizing and distributing test cases on multiple machines. Our approach is based on a functional dependency graph (FDG) of a web application. We partition the test suite into test sets according to the functionalities and associate the test sets with each module of the FDG. The high priority modules and their associated test sets are then distributed evenly among the available machines. Moreover, we further prioritize the test cases by using inter-procedural control flow graphs within individual functional modules. Our suggested approach reduces the test suite execution time and helps in detecting the faults early in a regression testing cycle. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique through an experimental study of a web application and measuring the performance of our technique by using the well known APFD metric.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the relationship between recently modified source code and the selection of text-based regression test cases. The main reason is that our industrial partner uses release notes documents to perform such a selection, but these documents are not so well-written as the text-based test cases. Therefore, we intend to extract useful text from source code to see whether they can serve as a source of keywords in the selection process. We present an experiment that shows promising results about this hypothesis.},
